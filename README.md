As I was learning a few things in computer science, I came across logic gates and immediately got interested.
I wanted a good way to learn and master logic gates as fast and effectively as possible.
I created a simple program that displays logic gates at random order and allows the user to identify and input the name of the logic gate displayed.

Program: 
- Prompts the user to press enter to start.
- A timer is started immediately enter is pressed.
- A random logic gate truth table is displayed.
- The user is required to identify and type the name of the logic gate displayed as fast as possible.
- The number of logic gates to be displayed can be changed (default = 10).
- After the last answeris submitted the results are outputed.
- Output contains the total number of truth tables displayed, time taken, and tables answered incorrectly.

You try out the code yourself and practice identifying logic gates as fast as possible yourself :)
